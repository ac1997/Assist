# Assist
Oftentimes, disabled/elderly citizens need assistance with daily activities such as grocery shopping or crossing the street. Assist connects those in need with altruistic volunteers, who can offer them assistance with such activities. Activities are designed to be carried out on-the-go, for someone with a few minutes to spare. 
In the app, disabled/elderly citizens put in requests specifying the task type, a description, and location. Volunteers view these tasks and accept tasks that are convenient for them, which notifies the disabled/elderly user. When a volunteer shares their location, the disabled user sees a map of the volunteerâ€™s location.
